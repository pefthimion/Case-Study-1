# Case-Study-1
Case Study 1 Project for Intro to Data Science

Phillip Efthimion

This project is to find the relationship of a country's GDP, GDP ranking, and income group for 190 ranked countries.

This is located in the Case-Study-1 Github repository.
In the data folder is the RMarkdown document, which should be opened to read everything.

There are 3 documents of code that are sourced in from the data sub folder: download, tidying, and merging. 
The RMarkdown calls on all of these.

In the analysis folder is a boplot comparing income groups and GDP which is also called upon.

If you h
